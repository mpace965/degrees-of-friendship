#Degrees of Friendship Project Charter

##Team Members
Evan Pagryzinski, Matthew Pace, Ryan Davis, Thomas Fanella

##Problem Statement
Testing the validity of the theory of “Six Degrees of Separation” which states that everyone and everything is six or fewer steps away, by way of relation, so that a chain of “a friend of a friend” statements can be made to connect any two people in a maximum of six steps. 

##Project Objectives
1. Develop an algorithm that efficiently traverses social medias’ connections and finds a series of six (or less) connections between any two given nodes (people).
2. Create a web application with a user interface that will allow for an interactive experience in testing this theory and visualizing each set of relations.
3. Set-up a server that will run the web app and allow for intensive and fast back-end processes.
4. Implement intermittent processes that will collect the necessary data from social media in a timely manner.
5. Time permitting: Enhance the algorithm to find an optimal set of connections rather than any valid set of six (or less) connections.
6. Time permitting: Data mine a large number of sets of connections and display more informative statistical data so that the user is not only seeing evidence for this theory on a case-by-case basis.
7. Lots of time permitting: Adapt the algorithm to allow for three given nodes and find the optimal path between them and potentially find the “forking” node where all three nodes connect.

##Stakeholder
_Users_: Curious internet denizens wanting to explore theirs or others’ connections.

_Customers_: Most likely, social media websites that are willing to show how connected users really are throughout their website or application. 

_Developers_: Evan Pagryzinski, Matthew Pace, Ryan Davis, Thomas Fanella

_Project Coordinator_: Hasini Gunasinghe

##Deliverables
* User interface that is clean-cut and friendly which will allow for interaction and visualization of the connections.
* Algorithm designed to efficiently find connections between two nodes (people).
* This program will be evidence that supports (or potentially contradicts, though unlikely) the theory of “Six Degrees of Separation”.
